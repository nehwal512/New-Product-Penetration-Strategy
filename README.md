# New-Product-Penetration-Strategy
Optimizing the New Product Penetration Strategy by reaching out to the most probable buyers.

A supermarket is offering a new line of organic products. The supermarket management wants to determine which customers are likely to 
purchase these products.The supermarket has a customer loyalty program. As an initial buyer incentive plan, the supermarket provided 
coupons for the organic products to all of the loyalty program participants and collected data that includes whether these customers 
purchased any of the organic products. The Target Buy has two categories (1 being the customers who bought the organic products 
and 0 are the customers who didnâ€™t buy the organic products from the loyalty program). The business wants to ignore Target Amount 
as of now. The organics data set 13 variables and over 22,000 observations. The variables in the data set are shown below with the 
appropriate roles and levels.
